Test Case 2: Random Generation Test with Error Handling
Scenario:
The user uses the random generation option and tests error handling by entering non-numeric values.

Input:
Matrix Size (N): 5
(During input, if a non-numeric value is entered, the program will prompt again until a valid integer is given.)

Input Mode: 2 (Random Generation)

Number of Threads:

First attempt: enter a non-numeric value (e.g., "abc").
Then enter a valid value within the range, e.g., 3.

Expected Behavior:
The program will prompt for matrix size and re-prompt until a valid numeric value is provided.
For random generation, the program automatically fills a 5Ã—5 matrix with random numbers between 0 and 99 and prints the generated matrix.
When prompted for the number of threads, if a non-numeric value (or an invalid number outside the range 1 to 5) is entered, the program will clear the input error and re-prompt until a valid number (e.g., 3) is provided.

The matrix rows are divided among 3 threads. The assignment might be:

Thread 0: 2 rows
Thread 1: 2 rows
Thread 2: 1 row

The program computes the total sum of all matrix elements, displays the thread assignments, the total sum, and the execution time.
