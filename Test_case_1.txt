Test Case 1: Manual Input Test
Scenario:
The user manually enters the matrix values.

Input:
Matrix Size (N): 3
Input Mode: 1 (Manual Input)

Matrix Elements:

Row 0: 1, 2, 3
Row 1: 4, 5, 6
Row 2: 7, 8, 9

Number of Threads: 2

Expected Behavior:
The program validates that 3 is a valid matrix size.
For manual input, it prompts for each element; if the user enters non-numeric input, the program will re-prompt until valid integers are provided.
The matrix is stored as:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The program then asks for the number of threads and ensures the user enters a valid number (between 1 and 3). 
With 2 threads, one thread might be assigned rows 0-1 and the other thread row 2.

The computed total sum is 45.
The program displays the thread assignments, total sum, and the execution time.
