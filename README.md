# Parallel-Matrix-Summation-Using-Pthreads
This project implements a parallel matrix summation program using pthreads in C++. The program calculates the sum of all elements in an NÃ—N matrix by dividing the matrix into chunks and processing each chunk concurrently using multiple threads. The solution supports both manual input and random generation of matrix elements.
